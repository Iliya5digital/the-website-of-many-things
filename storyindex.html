But Ella came up to her and said "what are you really mad about, because I kind of like being your sister. Not when your mad and mean all the time though!" Sally replied with, "Because I never liked you! You weren't ever suppose to be related with me! And you like Turd man! UNACCEPTABLE!" Ella was surprised on what she said, but stepped away to let Sally calm down. But in the mean-time Turd man found an app called 'Discord' and he thought it looked interesting! So he installed it and found somebody named "Slug gurl"! They all met up, and had a blast! As always Sally was still a little cranky but kind of got happier.
