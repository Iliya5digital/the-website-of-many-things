          <div class="capytext">
<p>There was a young artist named Maria who had a passion for painting animals. One day, while exploring a nearby forest, she came across a capybara. She was mesmerized by its beautiful eyes and gentle demeanor, and knew that she wanted to paint it. 
For the next few weeks, Maria spent hours in her studio, working diligently to capture the capybara's spirit in her painting. She used her favorite colors and techniques to create a vibrant painting that was both realistic and abstract. The painting depicted the capybara with its head held high, confident and proud. 
When Maria showed the painting to her friends and family, they were amazed. They all agreed that it was one of her best works and that it captured the beauty and grace of the capybara perfectly. 
To this day, Maria's painting continues to inspire many people who come across it. It reminds them of the wonders of nature and the beauty of the animal kingdom.</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, Blue the Raptor was a fierce and powerful creature that roamed the land. He was feared by all his enemies and none dared challenge him.
One day, while out hunting, Blue encountered a giant capybara. The capybara was huge, twice the size of Blue and its long claws and thick fur made it look like an invincible beast.
Blue was no ordinary raptor. He was brave and fearless and so he attacked the capybara without hesitation. The fight lasted for hours and when it was over, Blue had emerged victorious. The capybara lay dead on the ground and Blue was triumphant.
But the cost of victory was high. Blue had been severely wounded</p>

            <p>Once upon a time, Blue the Raptor was a powerful creature who roamed the land. He was feared by all the animals, and no one dared to stand in his way.
One day, Blue the Raptor encountered a large capybara, a rodent that was much larger than him. Blue the Raptor was not intimidated by the size of the capybara, and he immediately attacked the animal.
The capybara, however, was not intimidated by Blue the Raptor. The capybara fought back, using its sharp teeth and claws. The fight was fierce and lasted for a long time, but eventually, the capybara was able to overpower Blue the Raptor.</p>
